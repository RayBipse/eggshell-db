![workflow badge](https://github.com/RayBipse/eggshell-db/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Relational database model built in C++, written as a learning project.

Eggshell could support concurrent read and write operations. It utilizes a readers-writer lock.

It could also support atomicity, as previous pages are logged before they are modified.

The project includes two basic SQL commands,

```SQL
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```


## Architecture

The library is broken down into two sections, ``compiler`` and ``storage``, where the ``compiler`` composes inputs into
commands and ``storage`` is responsible for storing data.

## Usage

Must have C++-17 installed along with CMake.

Before the first build, run

```zsh
cmake -S . -B ./build 
```

To build, run

```zsh
cmake --build build
```

To run the REPL, first create an empty file, e.g., ``touch example.db``, then run

```zsh
build/repl example.db
```


## Future features

Some features to be implemented in the future are
- ``JOIN`` clauses
- Immutable B+ tree for complete atomic transactions
- Distributed database
- Error system (for now, we are just using ``exit`` on failure)


## Tests

eggshell uses [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest), which is simple to configure and run.
To test, run the following command after building:

```zsh
ctest --test-dir build
```

or alternatively,

```zsh
build && ctest
```

To run a specific test, do

```zsh
build/{TEST_FILE_NAME}
```

If intellisense is having trouble finding gtest, make sure to add the gtest onto the include path.
For VSCode, ``c_cpp_properties.json`` should have something like the following

```json
{
"configurations": [
        {
            "includePath": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/_deps/googletest-src/googletest/include"
            ],
        }
    ]
}
```
